Hey

I'm learning the MERN stack currently, and have elementary proficiency in said tech stack.
Fluent in Java, Novice in Python.

Interested in learning the nitty gritties of how tech works. (API's, Databases, Latency, Networks, Auth) -> Much more, it's an exhaustive list.

Looking for SDE oppurtunities.
